This calculator lets you type math at the same speed you type words. No more hunting for numbers and special charactersâ€”just use your normal typing speed and the letter keyboard to perform calculations. The experience is simple, fluid, and lag-free, making math feel as natural as writing.

Whether you prefer spelling out numbers (like "one seven two") or using traditional digits, this calculator understands both. You can mix and match numbers and words however feels most natural to you, giving you the flexibility to work the way you want.

Coming soon: a powerful customization feature that lets you define your own math rules and assign custom shortcuts to any operation. Want "square root" to be as simple as typing "the"? Or maybe you'd like to make all your math operations something completely silly and personalized? You'll have full control to customize exactly how your calculator responds, making it truly yours.
