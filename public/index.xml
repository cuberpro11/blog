      <title>Mastering Keyboard Shortcuts: How to Work at the Speed of Thought</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-typing-speed-matters-everywhere&#34;&gt;Why typing speed matters everywhere&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned the idea of working at the speed of thought, where you can think of what you need to do and it can just happen, almost like your laptop is controlled by your mind. Besides all the apps that you can use and all the settings that you can configure to help you accomplish this work style, the one thing that connects all of the tools is that you use is, your keyboard. This means that the more fluent with your keyboard you are and the faster that you can type, the more things and the quicker you can get things done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From Flat to Fast: The Science of Full‑Travel Keyboards Top Typists Rely On</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-keyboards-can-allow-you-to-type-at-300-wpm&#34;&gt;What keyboards can allow you to type at 300 wpm?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the insane amount of skill and practice that it takes to be able to type that fast, which keyboard you have could effect how fast you can type a lot. This is why all the top typists carefully pick, mod, and use every keyboard that they get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every mechanical keyboard has three main comments that effect the typing experience: switches, keycaps, and layout.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Perfect AI Prompt Formula: How to Get Exactly What You Want Every Time</title>
      <link>https://nolagmind.com/posts/third_post/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-you-should-take-the-time-to-learn-to-prompt&#34;&gt;Why you should take the time to learn to prompt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When most people are writing a prompt to an LLM they only write a sentence or two. While this is straight forward, it normally leads to generic results that sometimes aren&amp;rsquo;t even helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to this is to take the time to write a nice prompt that is catered to your certain use case. When writing a good prompt there is a specific structure to follow, which both makes it easer to start writing the prompt and for the LLM to understand what you want. By following the five-part formula you can ensure that you will always get a response from the AI that is useful for your specific use case.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The No-Click Principle: Why Your Mouse is Slowing You Down (and How to Fix It)</title>
      <link>https://nolagmind.com/posts/seccond_post/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-the-no-click-principle&#34;&gt;What is the no-click principle?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the idea that taking your hand of the keyboard to reach for the mouse will significantly reduce your productivity. This is because of the time and context switch costs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Time Cost:&lt;/strong&gt; Every reach for the mouse is a few seconds lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Context Switch Cost:&lt;/strong&gt; More critically, you interrupt your &lt;strong&gt;flow state&lt;/strong&gt;. You have to visually locate and track the cursor, and when you return to the keyboard, you have to mentally and physically reset your typing position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it might only take a couple seconds to do all the above and then get back to typing, if you add up those few seconds for all the times it happens in a day, week, or month, it can start to become hours of time that you could have otherwise spent working or thinking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Welcome to My Blog</title>
      <link>https://nolagmind.com/posts/first_post/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome! This is my first post - and a promise. I&amp;rsquo;ll be publishing here every day with small, useful snippets of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you’ll find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillars: programming, game dev, keyboards/typing, learning systems, and AI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;programming&#34;&gt;Programming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to build things, from small tools and automation scripts to entire games or course websites. I plan to share the process and ideas that go into making these tools here with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;game-development&#34;&gt;Game development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m currently building two indie games and have always found interest in coding something that I can actually play. So I would like to share that passion with you, weather it is a small update or reworking all the art.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there! I&amp;rsquo;m a 14-year-old who absolutely loves making things and playing with words. Whether I&amp;rsquo;m coding up a new project, crafting a story, or building something cool with my hands, I&amp;rsquo;m always excited to create and share what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that the best way to learn is by doing, and the best way to grow is by sharing. That&amp;rsquo;s why I started this blog - to document my journey of discovery and hopefully inspire others to start their own creative adventures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The experience is simple, fluid, and lag-free, making math feel as natural as writing.&lt;/p&gt;

You can mix and match numbers and words however feels most natural to you, giving you the flexibility to work the way you want.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
