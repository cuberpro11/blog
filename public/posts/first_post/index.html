What you’ll find:

Pillars: programming, game dev, keyboards/typing, learning systems, and AI.


Programming
I like to build things, from small tools and automation scripts to entire games or course websites. I plan to share the process and ideas that go into making these tools here with you.
Game development
I’m currently building two indie games and have always found interest in coding something that I can actually play. So I would like to share that passion with you, weather it is a small update or reworking all the art."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://nolagmind.com/posts/first_post/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.a090830a421002426baafbd314e38f149d77b4c48a12ee9312700d770b27fb26.css integrity="sha256-oJCDCkIQAkJrqvvTFOOPFJ13tMSKEu6TEnANdwsn+yY=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://nolagmind.com/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://nolagmind.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://nolagmind.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://nolagmind.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://nolagmind.com/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://nolagmind.com/posts/first_post/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://nolagmind.com/posts/first_post/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="No Lag Mind"><meta property="og:title" content="Welcome to My Blog"><meta property="og:description" content="Welcome!
