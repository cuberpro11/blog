Welcome! This is my first post - and a promise. I'll be publishing here every day with small, useful snippets of knowledge.

What you’ll find:
- Pillars: programming, game dev, keyboards/typing, learning systems, and AI.

***

### Programming
I like to build things, from small tools and automation scripts to entire games or course websites. I plan to share the process and ideas that go into making these tools here with you.

### Game development
I’m currently building two indie games and have always found interest in coding something that I can actually play. So I would like to share that passion with you, weather it is a small update or reworking all the art.

### Keyboards and typing
I love to explore alternative keyboard layouts, chorded input, and hardware/software setups to type faster and think clearer. I’ll cover ergonomics, mapping strategies, and how to utilize your keyboard as your weapon of choice: weather that is writing faster, making a game, or a mobile app. Your keyboard is what you use to interface with your device, with the entire web, therefore you should take the time to care about it, to learn about it, and to enhance it and what you can do with it.

### Learning systems
I’m obsessed with learning new skills and hobbies, from learning to juggle to cubing, I think have some pretty good techniques and strategies to help you learn anything and everything.

### AI
I treat AI as a second pair of hands always ready to help, but in order for it to be actually helpful you have to know what to tell it to do and how you should tell it. Through lots of experimentation a research I think I have developed one of the most powerful AI workflows. I Would love to teach you how you can know what to tell it to do and how.

### Inspiration
I’ve been obsessed with the idea that you can open your device and do anything that you need faster than you can think about what to do. I have built a workflow around this philosophy and feel that it is time to show it to the world.

### Note
I am not the best at anything that I do, there will always be someone better than you, but I do think that by sharing my stories and how I do things that I can do my part and help empower my readers to exceed and excel at everything that they do.

Thanks for reading. And I hope to see you here tomorrow.
