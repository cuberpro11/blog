      <title>The No-Click Principle: Why Your Mouse is Slowing You Down (and How to Fix It)</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-the-no-click-principle&#34;&gt;What is the no-click principle?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the idea that taking your hand of the keyboard to reach for the mouse will significantly reduce your productivity. This is because of the time and context switch costs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Time Cost:&lt;/strong&gt; Every reach for the mouse is a few seconds lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Context Switch Cost:&lt;/strong&gt; More critically, you interrupt your &lt;strong&gt;flow state&lt;/strong&gt;. You have to visually locate and track the cursor, and when you return to the keyboard, you have to mentally and physically reset your typing position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it might only take a couple seconds to do all the above and then get back to typing, if you add up those few seconds for all the times it happens in a day, week, or month, it can start to become hours of time that you could have otherwise spent working or thinking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome! This is my first post - and a promise. I&amp;rsquo;ll be publishing here every day with small, useful snippets of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you’ll find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillars: programming, game dev, keyboards/typing, learning systems, and AI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;programming&#34;&gt;Programming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to build things, from small tools and automation scripts to entire games or course websites. I plan to share the process and ideas that go into making these tools here with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;game-development&#34;&gt;Game development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m currently building two indie games and have always found interest in coding something that I can actually play. So I would like to share that passion with you, weather it is a small update or reworking all the art.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there! I&amp;rsquo;m a 14-year-old who absolutely loves making things and playing with words. Whether I&amp;rsquo;m coding up a new project, crafting a story, or building something cool with my hands, I&amp;rsquo;m always excited to create and share what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that the best way to learn is by doing, and the best way to grow is by sharing. That&amp;rsquo;s why I started this blog - to document my journey of discovery and hopefully inspire others to start their own creative adventures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
